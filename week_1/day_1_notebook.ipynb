    "* If you have the impression that something is off, wrong or super boring, please tell me, so I can make it better next time.\n",
    "* Before you come into class, you are required to have read the notebook for this day and watched all videos in it! You can also play around with the code, but this is not strictly necessary. However, it probably enables you to ask deeper questions in the course.\n",
    "* In class we will discuss the practice questions together. When we have finished, you will start working on the exercises on your own, but feel free to ask the staff for help.\n",
    "* Some videos I will send you, will have a defined starting time. This is intentional, as I think the parts of the video before the starting time have already been covered elsewhere or are not important.\n",
    "* Sometimes the topics of different videos will overlap. I could not really avoid this as I did not make them myself. However, you can also see this as a chance to review things you already heard. \n",
    "* YouTube allows you to watch videos faster! Very useful if you have the impression that someone in the video talks way to slow.\n",
    "* This course is meant to teach you programming and one big part of programming is finding answers on your own. If you are confused about something, please use [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) and google first. Then ask the staff. \n",
    "* Jupyter notebooks are a great way to show stuff, play around and describe workflows. However, if you do your programming assignments and the longer examples, I would recommend that you use Spyder (or any other editor/IDE when you already have a preference), as it allows much easier coding. \n",

    "## Spyder\n",
    "When you program, you could simply type everything in a text editor, but this is very unwieldy to use. Therefore, programmers use source code editors and integrated development environments (IDE). A code editor is just a text editor which is specifically designed for editing source code. An example for this would be Notepad++. However, those editors usually are limited in what they can do and more capable tools are needed. One of those tools are IDEs. IDEs also contain an editor, but many additional features that make your life as a programmer easier. For our course we will be using the Spyder IDE, which is already part of WinPython. To give you an impression on how Spyder works here is a short [introduction](https://youtu.be/a1P_9fGrfnU?t=3m). Do not worry too much about what code is shown in the video. It is only meant to show you how Spyder works."

Storing the values you create is a basic element of every program, as you cannot write meaningful code without ever storing anything. It would be like trying to solve a very difficult math problem without being allowed to write anything down. So the way to store something in Python are variables. Variables simply connect something that is stored in your computer's memory with a name, so we can find it again. Here is a simple example:\n"

    "## Data Types\n",
    "When working with data you often come across different types of data. So for example if you have an excel spreadsheet about flowers with two columns. One is the name of the flower and the second one is the average height of it. Obviously, both columns allow you to do different things. For example, you could group all flowers of one family and take the average of the height of all flowers in that family, but if you would try to take the average of the names of all flowers in the family this would not make much sense. This is caused by the different types of data of those columns. The name column has strings in it and the height column has numeric values (probably float). The same goes for Python. Here also variables have a certain type. [This video](https://youtu.be/OH86oLzVzzw) and [this article](http://pythonvisually.com/ebook/primitive-data-types.html) explain the concept in a bit more depth. As explained in the video, the \"type\" function tells us which type a variable has. This can be very useful to determine if your program does what you expect it to do. For example what would this line here return?"
