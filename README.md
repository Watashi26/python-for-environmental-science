# Python for Environmental Science
Repo for the Jupyter notebooks and code for a programming course at the Justus-Liebig-University Giessen. This course is meant to get students from not knowing how to program at all, to being able to use the pandas library to work with data and make good figures with matplotlib. I try to get the topics across in a universal way, so the skills taught are not restricted to environmental science. The title is meant to refer that this course covers things, that are useful when working in environmental science and is less about environmental science itself.  

The intended way to teach this course is the following:

This is a reversed classroom course, which means that the students are meant to take a look at the notebook on the day before class, watch all the videos and at least read the practice questions. In the classroom the students and teacher discuss the practice questions and then the students do the exercises on their own, but can ask the teacher at any time to help them out. This way enables the students to get the most knowledge out of their teachers and also allows students to even do this course with no teacher at all (though it is probably quite helpful to have one).

If you want to contribute, I'd be happy to hear from you. The easiest way is to simply send me a pull request. If any questions arise, please contact [me](https://www.uni-giessen.de/fbz/fb09/institute/ilr/wasser/mitarbeiter/copy_of_houska).

If you do not have a Python distribution on your computer already, I can recommend [WinPython](https://winpython.github.io/), but the course is also doable with other ones.

This course is based on Jupyter Notebooks; if you do not know how to use them, take a look [here](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/tutorial-jupyter-notebook).
