    "This day is meant to cover the usage of matplotlib (and to some extension seaborn), but first I would like to get a concept across that will help you to make nicer plots. The [data-ink ratio](https://youtu.be/JIMUzJzqaA8). This concept helps you to focus your graphics on the most essential parts. The following two bar charts represent the most extreme examples for a very high and a very low data to ink ratio.\n",

Also, you might wanna take a look at [this article](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003833) for \"10 simple rules for better figures\", but this is optional.\n",

    "## Matplotlib Usage\n",
    "After this is out of the way, let us start with the real topic for today: **matplotlib**. matplotlib is the main package in Python for 2D graphics (though it can do a bit 3D as well) and allows you to create publication ready figures with relative ease. For starters take a look at [this video](https://youtu.be/V-OWkPCYa0s) (it is a bit hard to understand, but I could not find a better video that covers this topic; take a look at the next section for an outline of what you should have understood from the video; you can probably stop watching after ~ 20 minutes, as he mainly talks about maps after that) to get a general feel for the way matplotlib is structured and the cool things you will be capable of once you get the hang of it. And [this video](https://youtu.be/q7Bo_J8x_dw) for other basic information and simple plotting.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Matplotlib Structure\n",
    "As we learned in the video matplotlib is relatively similar to matlab, but has a few differences. First of all, it is free and open source, which allows a much larger community to work on it. The second important thing is the anatomy of matplotlib. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Chilling](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/pyconcanada2015-151111021204-lva1-app6892/95/matplotlib-up-and-running-pycon-canada-2015-9-638.jpg?cb=1447208065)\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see in this picture matplotlib graphics subdivides intro three main things:\n",
    "* Figure: This is the overarching structure that contains everything else. If you work with several subplots, they are contained in one single figure, also.\n",
    "* Axes: This is where most of the real work happens, meaning that you will plot the things you want with the axes. \n",
    "* Axis: The x, and y axis which you can access and work with seperately.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interfaces of matplotlib:\n",
    "* pyplot: This is the real deal. If you use matplotlib, you should access it over pyplot. It allows you to easily create figures and change parts of them. \n",
    "* object-oriented API: this is useful if you want to embed your matplotlib figure in something like a webpage. But when you use matplotlib for science you can probably forget about it. It allows you more control, but is also more complicated than pyplot. \n",
    "\n",
    "More good things to know about pyplot:\n",
    "* pyplot can work with several figures\n",
    "* if you call pyplot without having a figure, it will create one for you\n",
    "* pyplot.gca() gives you the current axes, pyplot.gcf() gives you the current figure\n",
    "* pyplot.close() clears everything, so you can avoid plotting in old figures\n",
    "* matplotlib works quite well with pandas dataframes\n",
    "\n",
    "An exhausting course on matplotlib can be found [here](https://github.com/zutn/oreilly-matplotlib-course) if you want to dive in deep.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practice Questions\n",
    "* What is the scripting layer of matplotlib and what is it used for?\n",
    "* What is the difference between a figure, axes and an axis?\n",
    "\n",
    "Have no worries, we will usually use pyplot to make things easier, but it can sometimes be helpful to know what happens behind the scenes of matplotlib. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Most Basic Plotting\n",
    "So, after this introduction let us try a bit of plotting ourselves. As stated in the videos the most basic to plot things in matplotlib is the plot function, which allows you to draw dots or lines to represent your data. First let's start with a line."
